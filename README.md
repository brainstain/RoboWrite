RoboWrite
=========
Build a robot with an optional writting pen and you are good to go.
Use AccelStepper to setup the two stepper motors for the wheels.
Then set the width of the wheels and the diameter of the wheels.
Create the object RoboWrite and use the public methods to move the robot around using the penUp() and penDown() to move the pen.
